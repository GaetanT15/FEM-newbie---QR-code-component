## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS Nesting

### What I learned

Although I'm fairly advanced in web integration, I decided to tackle this challenge from scratch. Going back to the basics is never a bad thing and helps strengthen fundamentals.

For this project, I chose to use **CSS nesting** to organize my code logically by component blocks. This approach makes the code more readable and maintainable.

I considered implementing a layout with CSS Grid, but ultimately opted for a simpler solution using Flexbox. The goal was to save time, especially on responsive design which remains straightforward with this approach.

My methodology consisted of first creating a complete **UI kit** before developing the component itself:
- Defining CSS variables (colors, spacing)
- Setting up typography
- Establishing the font size scale

This approach gives me a solid and consistent foundation before building the component itself.

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my skills in:
- CSS organization and architecture
- CSS Grid layouts
- Optimizing development workflows
- Deepening modern technologies (CSS nesting, React JS, advanced web animations)
